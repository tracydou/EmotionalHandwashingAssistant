This is the place to hold all codes needed for my thesis project, which
tries to insert a BayesAct Engine into the old Handwashing System so as
to provide prompts with emotional considerations. The most important
part of this project is to implement an EPACalc, which can calculates
EPA values from information extracted from kinect cameras.

More details of this project can be found in the Design Doc:

This project is built up on the work of two other researches: BayesAct
and COACH. The former is accessible via https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jhoey/research/bayesact/index.php
and the former is accessible via http://www.ot.utoronto.ca/iatsl/projects/intell_env.htm
