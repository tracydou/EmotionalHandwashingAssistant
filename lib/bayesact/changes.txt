This file describes some changes that were made by Aaron Vaartjes during his 
revamping of the code/writing of the C++ version.  They can be ignored by anyone
looking at this code for the first time.  

=====
Usage
=====

-----------
FVarSampler
-----------

** Old Usage **
(tmpfv,wgt,tmpH,tmpC) = sampleFvar(fvars,tvars,self.iH,self.iC,self.isiga, \
                                   self.isigf_unconstrained_b, \
                                   state.tau,state.f,state.get_turn(),[],[])
tmpfv=tmpfv.transpose()

** New Usage **
fv = fVarSampler.sampleNewFVar()
fv = fv.transpose()



sampleNext:

** Old Usage **
newsample = self.sampleNext(fvars,tvars,sample,sample.get_turn(),aab,observ,paab)

** New Usage **
fVarSampler = FVarSampler(self.isiga, self.isigf, sample.tau, \
                          sample.f, self, sample.get_turn(), \
                          aab, observ)

newsample = self.sampleNext(fVarSampler, fvars, tvars, sample, \
                            aab, paab)

** Notes **
The main benefits of the next class is that the FVarSampler initialization
contains expensive computations. This means that it can be used outside of some
loops for a speedup.

-----------
TauMappings
-----------

** Old Usage **
(tmpH,tmpC) = instHCfromTau(tvars,H,C,tau,turn)


** New Usage **
(self.h, self.c) = self.agentMappings.getHC(tau)

This new version is both faster and slightly easier to understand.
