Codes in this folder are from a subfolder, trunk/tools/DTreeTraining within the repo hosting COACH codes.
The COACH codes can be downloaded via git from https://iatslsource.org/git/coach.git. Make sure you download
the x64_kinect branch. Codes in the DTreeTraining repo were last updated by Stephen Czarnuch <stephen.czarnuch@gmail.com>.
More info of the COACH project can be found at http://www.ot.utoronto.ca/iatsl/projects/intell_env.htm

Codes in this file may have been changed a little bit to be used as a libarary for my thesis project EHwA.
The changes (if any) are documented below.

More details of EHwA can be found at
